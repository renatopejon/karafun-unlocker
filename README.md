# Karafun Unlocker
A simple unlocker for Karafun .kfn files

The [original code](https://gist.github.com/WinslowJosiah/2bffe00b5abf1817a512988c87903225) was made by [Josiah Winslow](https://github.com/WinslowJosiah).
I just developed a very simple graphical interface to help users that doesn't have knowledge with Python and terminal.

## How to use

Just download the .exe file [here](https://github.com/renatopejon/karafun-unlocker/releases/tag/v1.0) and open it.
